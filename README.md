# Humans of Albania
**A blog application from scratch using Node.js, Express, MySQL, Bulma, jQuery and Ajax.**

Assuming, You have *Node*, *npm* and *Xampp* properly installed on your machine, you need to:

**1.** Clone or download the project.  
**2.** Import the database *humans.sql* to phpMyAdmin. (see file at root directory)  
**3.** Start *Apache* and *MySQL* from *Xampp Control Panel*.  
**4.** Navigate to inside the project folder on terminal.  
**5.** Do an *npm install* for installing all the project dependencies.  
**6.** Then *npm run start* (*webpack* will be watching your files and the server will automatically restart when your code changes). :)  
**7.** Now, it should be as easy as typing *localhost:3000* into your favourite web browser. ;)  
  
* It is recommended against committing your .env file to version control. (I have commited it, just to make easier for everyone who wants to run the project.)
*process.env* now has the keys and values I have defined in my *.env* file. (You will have to change them because you probably have different configurations on phpMyAdmin. :D)
