# Humans Of New York II
A yelp-like application from scratch using Bulma, Node, Express, MySQL, jQuery and Ajax.

Assuming, You have node and npm properly installed on your machine, you need to:

1. Download the code
2. Import the database *humans.sql* to phpMyAdmin. (see file at root directory)
3. Navigate to inside the project folder on terminal, where you would hopefully see a package.json file. :)
4. Do an *npm install* for installing all the project dependencies.
5. Then *npm start* or *node app.js* to get the app running on local host (if you have nodemon installed globally on your computer you can also run nodemon app.js).
6. Now, it should be as easy as typing *localhost:3000* into your favourite web browser.

* It is recommended against committing your .env file to version control. (I have commited it, just to make easier for everyone who wants to run the project.)
*process.env* now has the keys and values I have defined in my *.env* file. (Feel free to change them in case you have different configurations on phpMyAdmin.)
