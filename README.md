# HumansOfNewYorkII
A yelp-like application from scratch using Bulma, Node, Express, MySQL, jQuery and Ajax.

Assuming, You have node and npm properly installed on your machine, you need to:

1. Download the code
2. Import the database 'humans.sql' to phpMyAdmin. (see file at root directory)
3. Navigate to inside the project folder on terminal, where you would hopefully see a package.json file. :)
4. Do an npm install for installing all the project dependencies.
Then npm start or node app.js to get the app running on local host.
(if you have nodemon installed globally on your computer you can also run nodemon app.js)
