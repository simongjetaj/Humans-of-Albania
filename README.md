# Humans Of New York II
**A yelp-like application from scratch using Bulma, Node, Express, MySQL, jQuery and Ajax.**

Assuming, You have *Node*, *npm* and *Xampp* properly installed on your machine, you need to:

**1.** Download the code  
**2.** Import the database *humans.sql* to phpMyAdmin. (see file at root directory)  
**3.** Start *Apache* and *MySQL* from *Xampp Control Panel*.  
**4.** Navigate to inside the project folder on terminal, where you would hopefully see a package.json file. :)  
**5.** Do an *npm install* for installing all the project dependencies.  
**6.** Then *npm start* or *node app.js* to get the app running on local host (if you have nodemon installed globally on your computer you can also run *nodemon app.js*).  
**7.** Now, it should be as easy as typing *localhost:3000* into your favourite web browser.  

* It is recommended against committing your .env file to version control. (I have commited it, just to make easier for everyone who wants to run the project.)
*process.env* now has the keys and values I have defined in my *.env* file. (Feel free to change them in case you have different configurations on phpMyAdmin.)
